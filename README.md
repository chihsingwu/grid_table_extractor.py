# grid_table_extractor.py
This repository contains a Python engine designed to efficiently extract structured table data from PDF documents, with a primary focus on tables that feature visible grid lines.
It serves as a crucial pre-processing step for AI systems (like Large Language Models) that require clean, structured input for analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose & Problem Solved

Traditional PDF text parsers often struggle with complex document layouts, especially tables, leading to fragmented and noisy text output. This engine aims to solve the "garbage context" problem by accurately extracting tabular data.

It is particularly useful for workflows where:
* High-quality, structured table data is needed from PDFs.
* Downstream AI models (like LLMs or BERT) require clean, matrix-like input rather than raw, jumbled text.
* Automated extraction needs to leverage the clear visual cues of grid lines.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Focus on Grid-Aligned Tables**: Optimized for PDFs where table cells are clearly delineated by visible horizontal and vertical lines.
* **Leverages `pdfplumber`**: Utilizes `pdfplumber` for robust visual-based table detection and initial cell-level text extraction.
* **Intelligent Data Structuring with `pandas`**: Projects extracted cell content into `pandas.DataFrame` objects, enabling:
    * Automatic inference of data types (numbers, percentages, strings, etc.).
    * Basic cleaning and normalization of cell content.
    * Facilitating "Excel-like logic" for data recognition.
* **LLM-Friendly Output**: Outputs extracted tables in easily consumable formats such as Markdown table strings and JSON.

## 🚀 Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/grid_table_extractor.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/grid_table_extractor.git)
cd grid_table_extractor
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt content:

pdfplumber
pandas
openpyxl # For broader Excel compatibility (e.g. if dealing with .xlsx outputs from other tools)
🛠️ Usage
To extract tables from a PDF file, run the script from your terminal:

Bash

python grid_table_extractor.py --input path/to/your/document.pdf --output extracted_tables.json
--input: Path to the PDF file you want to process (e.g., paper1.pdf).

--output: (Optional) Path to save the extracted tables in JSON format. If omitted, the JSON output will be printed to the console.

--debug: (Optional) Add this flag to enable detailed debug logging.

Example:

Bash

python grid_table_extractor.py --input documents/sample_paper.pdf --output output/extracted_tables.json --debug
💡 Future Enhancements (Vision)
This engine is a foundation. Future work could include:

Advanced Grid Inference: Implementing sophisticated Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques (like those involving CNNs) to infer grid lines in tables that lack visible borders, based on text alignment and spacing cues.

Deep Data Logic Integration: Further leveraging pandas to apply advanced data validation rules and contextual logic to the extracted content, enabling more complex "fill-in-the-blanks" or consistency checks within the table data.
